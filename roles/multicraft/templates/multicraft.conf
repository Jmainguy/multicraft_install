## to the DB and used by the control panel to connect to the daemon.

## When not using absolute/relative paths the setting is taken to be
## relative to the home directory of the user configured by the "user"
## setting.
## Examples:
## - Changing "baseDir" to ./multicraft will cause multicraft to search
##   all the files in a subdirectory "multicraft" of the directory it's

## security.
## default: false

## filesystem entry. You can disable this if this check causes issues
## on your particular filesystem.
